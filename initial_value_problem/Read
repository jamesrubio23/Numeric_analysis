Different methods implemented in Matlab monopass or multipass to solve an initial value problem:

  1.- Given two methods that solve the problem the program analyzes the two solution.
  
  2.- Compares the input method with ode45 and shows different graphics to compare both solutions.
  
  3.- Function that compares the solution from a method with the exact solution.
  
  4.- Euler's improved method.
  
  5.- Predictive-Corrector Method that uses Adams Bashforth as the predictor method and Adams-Moulton as the corrector method. 
     We initialize the first step with Euler's improved method.
  
  6.- Shows the comparison between methods ode45 and ode15.
  
  7.- Euler's implicit method.
  
  8.- Euler's modified method.
  
  9.- Adams'-Bashforth method of 4 steps method intializing the first steps with Runge-Kutta of order 3.
  
  10.- Euler's explicit method.
  
  Data.- Examples of inputs.
  
  Plot.- Function used to plot a solution.
